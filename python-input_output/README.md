# Python Input/Output Project

This project contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate various input and output operations, as well as JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Files

- [0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py): A script that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
- [1-write_file.py](1-write_file.py): A script that writes a given string to a file, creating the file if it doesn't already exist.
- [2-append_write.py](2-append_write.py): A script that appends a specified string to the end of an existing file.
- [3-to_json_string.py](3-to_json_string.py): A script that converts a Python object into a JSON string.
- [4-from_json_string.py](4-from_json_string.py): A script that converts a JSON string back into a Python object.
- [5-save_to_json_file.py](5-save_to_json_file.py): A script that saves a Python object as a JSON file.
- [6-load_from_json_file.py](6-load_from_json_file.py): A script that loads a Python object from a JSON file.
- [7-add_item.py](7-add_item.py): A script that takes command-line arguments, adds them to a list, and saves the list as a JSON file.
- [8-class_to_json.py](8-class_to_json.py): A script that returns the dictionary representation of a given object.
- [9-student.py](9-student.py): A script that defines a `Student` class and provides a method to convert it to a JSON-compatible dictionary.
- [10-student.py](10-student.py): An enhanced version of the `Student` class that allows filtering of JSON attributes.
- [11-student.py](11-student.py): A further extension of the `Student` class that includes a method for reloading attributes from a JSON dictionary.
- [12-pascal_triangle.py](12-pascal_triangle.py): A script that generates and returns Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows.

## Usage

To use these scripts, simply run them with the appropriate parameters in your terminal. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
