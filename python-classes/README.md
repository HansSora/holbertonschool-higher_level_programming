# Python Classes Project

Welcome to the Python Classes project! This project contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating various implementations of a `Square` class. Each script builds upon the previous one, adding new features and improving the class functionality.

## Directory Structure

The project directory `python-classes` contains the following files:

- [0-square.py](#0-squarepy)
- [1-square.py](#1-squarepy)
- [2-square.py](#2-squarepy)
- [3-square.py](#3-squarepy)
- [4-square.py](#4-squarepy)
- [5-square.py](#5-squarepy)
- [6-square.py](#6-squarepy)

## File Descriptions

### 0-square.py

This file contains a basic definition of a `Square` class with no additional attributes or methods.

### 1-square.py

This file introduces an `__init__` method to the `Square` class that allows setting the size of the square.

### 2-square.py

In this file, the `Square` class is updated to include validation for the size attribute, ensuring it is an integer and non-negative.

### 3-square.py

This file extends the `Square` class to include an `area` method that calculates and returns the area of the square.

### 4-square.py

The `Square` class in this file adds a property for `size` with getter and setter methods and includes the `area` method.

### 5-square.py

This file further enhances the `Square` class by adding a `my_print` method to print a square made of `#` characters.

### 6-square.py

In this final implementation, the `Square` class includes a `position` attribute to manage the squareâ€™s position and adjust the output of the `my_print` method accordingly.
