# Python Classes Project

Welcome to the Python Classes project! This repository contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating various implementations of a `Square` class. Each script builds upon the previous one, adding new features and improving the class functionality.

## Scripts Overview

### [0-square.py](0-square.py)

- **Description**: Contains a basic definition of a `Square` class with no additional attributes or methods.

### [1-square.py](1-square.py)

- **Description**: Introduces an `__init__` method to the `Square` class that allows setting the size of the square.

### [2-square.py](2-square.py)

- **Description**: Updates the `Square` class to include validation for the size attribute, ensuring it is an integer and non-negative.

### [3-square.py](3-square.py)

- **Description**: Extends the `Square` class to include an `area` method that calculates and returns the area of the square.

### [4-square.py](4-square.py)

- **Description**: Adds a property for `size` with getter and setter methods and includes the `area` method.

### [5-square.py](5-square.py)

- **Description**: Further enhances the `Square` class by adding a `my_print` method to print a square made of `#` characters.

### [6-square.py](6-square.py)

- **Description**: Includes a `position` attribute to manage the squareâ€™s position and adjusts the `my_print` method accordingly.
