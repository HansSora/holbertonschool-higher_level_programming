# Python - Abstract Classes

This project contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate the concepts of abstract classes, duck typing, and mixins. Each script illustrates different aspects of object-oriented programming in Python.

## Files

- [task_00_abc.py](task_00_abc.py): A script that defines an abstract class `Animal` with two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, each implementing the abstract method `sound`.
  
- [task_01_duck_typing.py](task_01_duck_typing.py): A script that defines an abstract class `Shape` with two concrete classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, implementing the methods `area` and `perimeter`.

- [task_02_verboselist.py](task_02_verboselist.py): A custom list class `VerboseList` that extends the built-in list with additional functionality and prints messages on append, extend, remove, and pop operations.

- [task_03_countediterator.py](task_03_countediterator.py): A script that defines a `CountedIterator` class that keeps track of how many items have been iterated over, providing a count of iterations.

- [task_04_flyingfish.py](task_04_flyingfish.py): A script that demonstrates multiple inheritance with a `FlyingFish` class that inherits from both `Fish` and `Bird`, showcasing behavior specific to flying fish.

- [task_05_dragon.py](task_05_dragon.py): A script that defines a `Dragon` class using mixins for swimming and flying behaviors, illustrating how to compose functionality through inheritance.

## Usage

To use these scripts, run them individually in your terminal. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
