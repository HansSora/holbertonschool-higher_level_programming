# Python-More_Classes

This project contains implementations of a `Rectangle` class in Python, demonstrating concepts such as object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and method overriding. Each file builds upon the previous one, adding features and functionality to the `Rectangle` class.

## Files Overview

- [0-rectangle.py](0-rectangle.py): 
  - An empty `Rectangle` class to establish the basic structure.

- [1-rectangle.py](1-rectangle.py): 
  - Introduces the `__init__` method to initialize width and height attributes.
  - Implements property setters and getters for width and height with basic validation.

- [2-rectangle.py](2-rectangle.py): 
  - Expands the `Rectangle` class to include methods for calculating the perimeter and area.

- [3-rectangle.py](3-rectangle.py): 
  - Adds string representation methods (`__str__`) to visualize the rectangle as a grid of `#` characters.

- [4-rectangle.py](4-rectangle.py): 
  - Continues enhancing the `Rectangle` class with representation methods and more robust features.

- [5-rectangle.py](5-rectangle.py): 
  - Implements a destructor method (`__del__`) to manage instances of the class.

- [6-rectangle.py](6-rectangle.py): 
  - Introduces a class variable to count the number of instances of `Rectangle`.

- [7-rectangle.py](7-rectangle.py): 
  - Allows customization of the print symbol used in the string representation of the rectangle.

- [8-rectangle.py](8-rectangle.py): 
  - Adds a static method to compare the areas of two rectangles.

- [9-rectangle.py](9-rectangle.py): 
  - Introduces a class method to create a square, enhancing the versatility of the class.
